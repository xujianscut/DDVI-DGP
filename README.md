# Sparse Inducing Points in DGPs: Enhancing Modeling with DDVI

## Overview

This project implements the methods proposed in the paper "Sparse Inducing Points in Deep Gaussian Processes: Enhancing Modeling with Denoising Diffusion Variational Inference." 
The code is built using the `gpytorch` module, aiming to enhance the modeling capabilities of Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) through sparse inducing points 
and Denoising Diffusion Variational Inference (DDVI).

## Dependencies

Before running the code, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- [gpytorch]
- [torch]
- [numpy]


You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install gpytorch
